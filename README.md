# Intel-Study---Hardware-Section---NEMU, a cloud hypervisor

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEMU is the large project in Intel open source projects. There are a lot of unique and interesting techniques which Intel has designed and developed for the Cloud technology compared with others such as Google Cloud and Microsoft Cloud. 

In my Github, I have focused profoundly the coding files which Intel has developed some techinques in order to optimize CPU, Memory as well as accelerate the power of hardware for Cloud.

Note: Because I have tried to code myself based on original files in order to UNDERSTAND profoundly Intel coding technique, so there is any problem related to coding technique, please check the Intel original files.
