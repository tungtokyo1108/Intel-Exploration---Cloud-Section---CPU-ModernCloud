# Intel-Exploration---Hardware-Section---NEMU, a cloud hypervisor

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEMU is the large project in Intel open source projects. There are a lot of unique and interesting techniques which Intel has designed and developed for the Cloud technology compared with others such as Google Cloud and Microsoft Cloud. 

In my Github, I have focused profoundly the coding files which Intel has developed some techinques in order to optimize CPU, Memory as well as accelerate the power of hardware for Cloud. 

- Kernel-based Virtual Machine Accelerator (KVM).
- TCG Accelerator.
- Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager Accelerator (HAXM).
- Hypervisor Framework Accelerator (HVF).
- Windows Hypervisor Platform Accelerator (WHPX).
- CPU Throttling (Dynamic frequency scaling) to manage the processor usage of an agent.

Note: I have tried to explore a number of files which have been useful with my own projects and works. All files have been re-coded carefully by basing on the Intel technical framewrok of original files, however I have tried to modify some parts sometime in order to satisfy my personal demands. Therefore there is any problem related to coding technique when you try to test them in your system, please check the Intel original files.
I have described specifically the Intel unique techniques in these files and some connections with my research projects. Please give me some comments if I have any mistake.
